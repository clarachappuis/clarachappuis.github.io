      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Just finished an amazing movie and unsure what to watch next? Don’t worry we’ve got you covered! Every movie you watch has a unique signature, a blend of themes and ideas beyond simple genres. What if the key to finding your next favorite film is not in the usual categories like "action" or "romance," but in uncovering deeper, hidden topics that truly reflect the movie?
        In this analysis, we dive into the art of movie recommendation. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a tool for discovering hidden topics in movies’ plots, we go beyond surface-level genres to identify the intricate themes that define each film. These topics form the foundation of a content-based recommendation system, helping us find movies with similar thematics.
