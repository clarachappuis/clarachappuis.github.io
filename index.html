      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">You just finished an amazing movie and you are unsure what to watch next? Don’t worry we’ve got you covered! 
          Every movie you watch has a unique signature, a blend of themes and ideas beyond simple genres. What if the key to finding your next favorite 
          film is not in the usual categories like "action" or "romance," but in uncovering deeper, hidden topics that truly reflect the movie?
          In this analysis, we dive into the art of movie recommendation. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a tool for discovering hidden topics 
          in movies’ plots, we go beyond surface-level genres to identify the intricate themes that define each film. These topics form the foundation of 
          a content-based recommendation system, helping us find movies with similar thematics. <br>
          At the end of the datastory you will also have the chance to test our movie recommendation system, to help you choose which movie you will watch this evening.<br>
          During this adventure we will try to answer the following questions: 
      </p>
  
      <ul style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20px;">
          <li>What topics can be recovered using LDA on the movie synopsis?</li>
          <li>Do these topics reflect the genres or labels from the MPST dataset?</li>
          <li>Are topics enough for movie recommendations?</li>
          <li>What additional features should we consider?</li>
      </ul>

      <p style="text-align: justify;"> For our task, we use three different datasets:</p>

      <ul style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20px;">
        <li>CMU Movie Summary Corpus: contains Wikipedia ID, Title and Genre of movies. </li>
        Download the <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/" download>dataset here</a> 
        <li>MPST: Dataset containing Movie Plot Synopses with Tags (labels). Used to retrieve movies' synopsis. </li>
          Download the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cryptexcode/mpst-movie-plot-synopses-with-tags?resource=download" download>dataset here</a>
        <li>IMDb ratings: Contains the ratings of many movies.</li>

    <!-- Data Exploration Section -->
    <section id="data-exploration">
      <h1>Data Exploration</h1>
      
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Before diving into the core part of the project, let's take a closer look at the datasets we're working with. 
        In this section, we will analyze the data sources, highlighting the key information that will be critical for our analysis. 
        This will help us better understand the structure of the datasets and identify the relevant features that we need to focus on in order to draw meaningful conclusions.</p>
        
      <h2> The Genres That Steal the Spotlight in the Movie Industry</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"> 
      Let’s roll the reel and uncover which genres are the true stars of the show and maybe stumble upon a few hidden gems along the way! <br>
  
      First, by analyzing the CMU Movie dataset, we see that we have 133 different genres in the database. Let's find the most recurrent ones:</p>
      
      <div class="center-content">
        <img src="/assets/img/genres.png" alt="Distribution of genres" style="width: 70%; height: auto; margin-bottom: 20px;">
      </div>
      
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Drama takes the lead as the most popular genre by far (what can we say, people love a bit of drama!). Action, Romance, 
        Crime and Horror also shine, showing that people enjoy laughter, love, excitement and also scaring themselves. On the other hand, niche genres like 
        "Costume Drama" and "Western" are less common, loved by smaller, more specific audiences.</p>
      
      <p style="text-align: justify;">But is genre alone enough to truly capture the essence of a movie? Not quite. The richness of a film lies in its story, the plot
        that unfolds and draws us in. To understand what makes these genres shine, let’s dive into the synopses that bring these movies to life. 
        By exploring the words used to describe films across genres, we can uncover patterns and themes that go beyond broad categories.<br>
        To visualize this, we’ve created word clouds for each genre, highlighting the most frequently used words in movie synopses. These clouds give us a glimpse 
        of the recurring themes and ideas that define each genre. Let’s take a closer look! </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to synopses, we also need movie ratings for our analysis. We will explore whether movies with similar themes tend to have
        similar ratings and examine if ratings are essential for our recommendation system. Ratings provide valuable insights in the context 
        of recommendations, as they directly indicate how much viewers enjoyed a movie. To gather this data, we found an IMDb dataset online that includes movie ratings.</p>

    <!-- LDA Section -->
    <section id="lda">
      <h1>Topics Detection</h1>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is an unsupervised machine learning method. It takes as inputs a corpus of documents, 
        in our case the movie synopses, and a number of topics. It then groups documents into the given number of topics based on the semantics of the documents. 
        Each topic is defined as a distribution of words and each movie has a distribution across topics. <br>
        Before performing LDA, we can have a quick look at what words appear often in the different genres:</p>
        <!-- PLOT WORDCLOUD -->
      <p style="text-align: justify;"> From the word clouds across different genres, we observe that certain words, such as 'find,' 'tell,' 'one,' and 'see,' appear consistently 
        across all genres. This is expected, as these are commonly used words. However, their large presence makes it difficult to discern clear trends 
        or distinctions among the genres. <br>
        Indeed, to have consistent and more representative topics it’s better to remove stop words, character names or punctuation. Once this is done, we run the LDA algorithm on 
        synopses for a various number of topics. The goal is to find which number of topics fits our data best. For each LDA model, we use a coherence 
        score to measure how consistent the topics are. <br>
        Here is the graph of coherence as a function of the number of topics:</p>
        
        <div class="center-content">
          <img src="/assets/plots/coherence_score.png" alt="Coherence Score" 
            style="width: 70%; height: auto; margin-bottom: 20px; filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg); background-color: black;">
          </iframe>
        </div>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        We pick the number of topics to be 15 since it gives the maximum coherence! This gives 15 different word distributions to which we attribute topic 
        names using a Natural Language Model. Here are the 15 topics discovered by the LDA model:

    <h1> Topics Exploration </h1> 
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> 
      Here we try to interpret our topics using pyLDAvis which is a common way of interpreting LDA results:
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <em> How to interact with the graph: </em></p>
    <ul style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 5px;">
      <li> Selecting a topic (click on a circle, or select from the top bar): updates the right panel to show the most relevant terms for that specific topic. </li>
      <li> Hovering over a term (Right Panel): highlights its contribution to the topic (red bar) and its overall frequency (grey bar). </li>
  </ul>


      <!-- plot LDA-->  
      <div class="center-content" style="margin-bottom: -40px; margin-top: -20px">
        <iframe
          src="/assets/plots/lda_visualisation.html" 
          alt="LDA_visualization" 
          style="width: 130%; height: 790px; margin-bottom: -40px; margin-top: -20px; transform: scale(0.8) translate(-15.5%, 0); filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg); background-color: black;">
        </iframe>
      </div>
      
    
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        This plot have many information and it is normal to be confused, don't worry! Let's break it down together. </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <em> LEFT PANEL - Intertopic Distance Map: </em> <br>
        Each movie synopsis in the corpus can be represented as a probability distribution over all topics. This creates 
        a high-dimensional space where each axis corresponds to a topic. PCA is used to reduces this space into just two dimensions (PC1 and PC2). <br>
        Each circle corresponds to a topic generated by the LDA model. The position and distance between the circles show how similar the topics are to each other.
        Closer circles mean topics share more overlapping terms, while distant circles represent more distinct topics. <br>
        The size of a circle reflects the prevalence of the topic in the corpus. Larger circles indicate that more synopsis are associated with that particular topic, meaning that
        it appears more often.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <em> RIGHT PANEL - Term Relevance and Bar Chart: </em><br>
        This panel lists the most important words for the currently selected topic. For each word, the bar chart shows two values:
        <ul style="text-align: left; margin-left: -5px; margin-top: -5px;">
          <li><span style="color: rgb(203, 94, 94);">Red Bar</span>: Frequency of the term in the selected topic</li>
          <li><span style="color: rgb(95, 112, 163);">Blue Bar</span>: Frequency of the term across all topics (corpus-wide)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <em> Relevance metric (λ) - </em>
        Adjusting λ balances the trade-off between:
        <ul style="text-align: left; margin-left: -5px; margin-top: -5px;">
            <li> λ=0: Showing terms exclusive to the topic </li>
            <li>λ=1: Showing terms based on their overall frequency across the entire corpus</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <em> GRAPH ANALYSIS </em><br>
        The topics are ordered based on the percentage of tokens that were used to create them. By setting the relevance to 1 (λ=1) and then 
        hovering over the words of a certain topic we can see how much each topic uses this word. Words like "army" appear in most topics. 
        But in order to differentiate each other, the topics also have words specific to them that can be seen when setting the relevance to 0 (λ=0). 
        We can then see that for Topic 7, "MacBeth" is an important word specific to this topic. <br>
        While only topics 11, 10 and 7 are isolated from the rest all other topics are still very different from each other but this is not evident 
        since the 15 dimensions of the topics are projected to only 2 dimensions.
      </p>

  <h2> Are topics linked to genres or labels? </h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"> 
    Let’s see if our topics share some similarity with other characteristics such as the genres or the labels of the movies. Here is a network of the topics, 
    and the links between them represent the number of genres (on the left) or labels (on the right) they have in common. The size of the nodes is proportional 
    to the prevalence of the topic as a main topic in the dataset.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    We observe that “Family and Everyday Life” is the most present main topic. We also see that “Action and Strategy” and “Urban Crime and Violence” have 
    the most genres in common. We calculate the probability of having a link if the genre were independent of the topics. This independent probability is 0.004%, 
    whether the proportion of links in the graph is 1.289%. This difference means that our topics reflect to some extent the genres of the movies. However for the 
    labels, the independent probability is equal to the proportion of links. This shows that our topics are completely independent of the labels.

  <h2> Are topics enough for recommendations?</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Now that we can categorize movies by their topics, we have a sense of their plot similarity. But is plot similarity enough for a recommendation system? <br>
      To check this we begin by assuming that similar movies tend to have similar ratings. After all, recommending movies solely based on the highest ratings 
      might not align with personal preferences. If someone enjoyed a cheesy, low-rated Christmas movie, they likely wouldn’t want to watch a critically 
      acclaimed Cannes-winning film next.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      The boxplot shows the IMDb ratings distribution across the top 20 movie genres, and we can observe clear trends across genres. Most genres have median 
      ratings between 6 and 7, suggesting that movies generally receive moderate reviews. Genres like Drama, Thriller, and Comedy show a wider spread of ratings, 
      indicating that audience opinions on these movies vary significantly. In contrast, genres such as Horror and Fantasy tend to have lower median ratings, with 
      a higher number of poorly rated movies. On the other hand, genres like Mystery, Science Fiction, and Crime Fiction show slightly higher median ratings and 
      fewer very low scores. Some genres, like Romantic Drama and World Cinema, have more consistent ratings with less variation. Overall, this plot highlights how 
      audience ratings vary across genres, with some receiving more favorable reviews and others showing a mixed reception.
